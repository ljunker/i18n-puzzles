# i18n-puzzles
This repository contains my solutions for the challenges and puzzles from the [i18n-puzzles](https://i18n-puzzles.com/about/) website.
The puzzles are designed to explore text processing and internationalization (i18n) concepts.
Each solution is implemented in **C** and focuses on solving real-world i18n-related problems.
